# My Advent of Code

This is my central repository for all Advent of Code solutions, plus some AI art courtesy
of the [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) for a bit of extra flair.

All solutions are designed to read the puzzle input file passed as stdin argument.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming 
puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming 
language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university
coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository
somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. 
If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something
similar.
